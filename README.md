# Predicting_medical_expenses_using_linear_regression
In order for an insurance company to make money, it needs to collect more in yearly premiums than it spends on medical care to its beneficiaries. As a result, insurers invest a great deal of time and money to develop models that accurately forecast medical expenses.
Medical expenses are difficult to estimate because the most costly conditions are
rare and seemingly random. Still, some conditions are more prevalent for certain
segments of the population. For instance, lung cancer is more likely among smokers
than non-smokers, and heart disease may be more likely among the obese.
The goal of this analysis is to use patient data to estimate the average medical care
expenses for such population segments. These estimates could be used to create
actuarial tables which set the price of yearly premiums higher or lower depending
on the expected treatment costs
